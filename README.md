Hoo, boy. Here we go with another project from The Odin Project!

Here's the deal: I enjoy coding so far. Making sense of the logic,
getting programs to work, all that. I'm living for those light-
bulb moments of understanding.

HOWEVER, designing stuff is still quite the challenge for me.
A restaurant page? You mean I need photos and a menu and all that?
I suppose I should take this opportunity to explore the bounds of
my creativity. This should be interesting...
